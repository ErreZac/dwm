# My build of the best WM of all times

My build of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org/). It includes a bunch of patches, plus I did some other tweaks to the code (I somewhat lost track of) to make it all work consistently.

## Patches:

This build includes the following patches:

- alpha
- attachbottom
- barpadding
- barpadding
- cool-autostart
- fixborders
- functionalgaps-pertagfunctionality
- keychord
- killunsel
- moveresize
- movestack
- pertag
- scratchpad
- smartborders
- statuspadding
- systray

## Colorschemes:

You can change colorschemes by including headers in colorschemes/ dir.

## Bar

I edited the bar so that you can add outer padding to the bar and systray. It looks good combined with [ibhagwan's picom](https://github.com/ibhagwan/picom) with rounded corners. You can add inner padding (more or less the rounding radius) to the first tag.
